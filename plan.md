    - **API & Utilities:**  
      - API endpoints in the api/ folder (chatbot.php, get_fee_structure.php, validate_discount.php)  
      - Utility and function files in includes/ (ai_chatbot.php, functions.php, notifications.php)
    - **Logging & Database:**  
      - logs/error.log  
      - database/college_db.sql

    ## Step-by-Step Outline of Changes & Checks

    1. **Documentation Review & Re-planning:**  
       - Read and compare TODO.md, TODO_FINAL.md, ENHANCEMENTS_*.md, and plan.md to list pending tasks and enhancements.  
       - Identify knowledge gaps; if any dependent files are missing, schedule further review before code changes.

    2. **Authentication Module Audit:**  
       - Compare authentication.php with authentication_fixed.php, ensuring uniform session handling, input sanitization, and robust error logging.
       - Implement try-catch mechanisms and update error messages with logging to error.log.

    3. **Reception Module Consolidation:**  
       - Evaluate dashboard_clean.php, dashboard_test.php, and reception_overview.php for overlap.  
       - Consolidate functionalities into a single dashboard with modern typography, clear spacing, and consistent layout.
       - Enhance visitor management, inquiries, and notifications with proper error handling.

    4. **Transport Module Enhancement:**  
       - Review transport_overview.php, vehicle_booking.php, maintenance_schedule.php, and inventory.php.  
       - Implement input validations (e.g., conflict detection, booking overlaps) and log errors appropriately.
       - Refactor UI elements to use modern CSS with responsive layouts.

    5. **Accounts & Financial Modules:**  
       - Audit dashboard.php, fee_balance_report.php, fee_receive.php, financial_reports.php, and manage_fees.php.  
       - Validate financial computations, confirm pending payments and overdue actions, and enhance error notifications.  
       - Update the user interface with modern typefaces and clear data visualizations.

    6. **HR, Director, Registrar, Teacher, and Student Modules:**  
       - Check all HR files (employee_management.php, attendance_management.php, performance_management.php, payroll_management.php) along with registrarâ€™s student_management_enhanced.php, reports.php, and student_finance.php.  
       - Ensure consistency and integrate robust validation and error logging.  
       - Modernize UI elements across modules using clean layouts and uniform spacing.

    7. **Hostel & Library Modules:**  
       - Evaluate hostel files (dashboard, hostel_overview.php, room_booking.php, maintenance_schedule.php, inventory.php) and library files (borrow_books.php, dashboard.php, manage_books.php, return_books.php, search_books.php).  
       - Add uniform error handling and update the CSS (using css/hostel.css and css/styles.css) to meet modern UI standards.
       
    8. **API & Utility Enhancements:**  
       - Review API endpoints in the api/ directory and ensure proper HTTP response codes and error handling are implemented.  
       - Update includes/functions.php and ai_chatbot.php to include robust error checks and input sanitization.
       
    9. **Error Logging & Database Handling:**  
       - Ensure that all modules correctly utilize db.php for database connections and that all error scenarios are logged in logs/error.log.  
       - Validate SQL queries and implement graceful fallback strategies.

    10. **UI/UX Modernization & Best Practices:**  
        - Update header.php and footer.php to enforce a clean, modern design with defined spacing, typography, and layout consistency.  
        - Standardize UI components across modules, ensuring responsive design and accessibility.
    
    ## Summary
    - This plan performs a system-wide audit to identify pending versus implemented files using documentation and code reviews.
    - Authentication, reception, transport, accounts, HR, director, registrar, student, teacher, hostel, and library modules are all examined.
    - Consolidation of duplicate files (e.g., multiple dashboards) is planned for consistency.
    - Enhancements include modern UI designs with improved typography, spacing, and error handling.
    - API endpoints are upgraded with proper response codes and validations.
    - Error logging and database operations are verified for robustness.
    - The plan emphasizes re-planning if any critical dependency is missed.
    - This structured approach ensures reliable integration and improved system performance.
